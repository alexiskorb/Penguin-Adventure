# Penguin-Adventure

This is a side-scrolling adventure game featuring a penguin hero.<br />
It was created in Java using Netbeans for my AP Computer Science course.<br />
I did most of the programming, and my partner, Michael Chiu, did most of the artwork.<br />
We created all code except for GameDriver.java, SoundDriver.java, and the files added by Netbeans.<br />

Notable Features:<br />
-Super cute penguin who gets new looks as he gains powers<br />
-Different upgrades that give you abilities such as gliding, wall-climbing, and fire-breathing<br />
-High score tracker and unlockable modes<br />
